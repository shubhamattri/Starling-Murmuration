# Starling-Murmuration
Modelling and Simulation of  fascinating phenomena - Starling Murmuration

Model and simulate the Reynolds Boid formula. We will computationally simulate the phenomenon by modelling each bird as an independent agent communicating and cooperating with other neighbouring agents. Our objective will be to measure from a realistic simulation the average energy spend by each bird, the angular momentum and the force that each bird has to withstand in a typical flight ritual.

Instruction to Run :

1. Download sfml lib in Linux
2. Run make to compile all src files
3. Run the command "./simulate-starlin" to run the program
